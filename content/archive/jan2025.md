## 2024 Recap

Happy 2025! We hope you all had a nice New Years!

The days are short and wet this time of year, which is a great time to look back on the season. We continued our weekly microgreen deliveries to Bay Hay & Feed, expanded our sweet potato plot, sold flowers and veggies at the roadside farmstand, and also grew some popcorn.

We also raised a batch of chickens with some friends and are considering expanding the flock in 2025:

When the chicks first moved in the sheep were very interested to say hello:

And Jimmy the donkey was always on guard duty:

We also sold some of our popcorn at Bay Hay & Feed for stocking stuffers:

Winter is great for catching up on movies, TV shows, and reading books, and having our own popcorn to enjoy is a nice treat:

## What the Bees are up to

The bees are mostly hunkered down this time of year and enjoying their honey harvest from the warmer months. If we get a sunny day they can be seen cleaning up their hive and out stretching their wings for a short flight, but mostly they stay home and are waiting for Spring flowers.

## 2025 Plans

We plan to continue growing microgreens, sweet potatoes, and corn this year. We are also going to grow a couple rows of winter squash, and try a small patch of wheat - hopefully we will be able to make a loaf of PNW sourdough bread! The farmstand will be open again this Spring once we have a steady supply of produce available, and will try to offer eggs when we have them. Hopefully the bees will have a productive year and will have some extra honey to share with us as well.

We sincerely appreciate everyone who supported us last year. One of the main reasons we grow food is to share it with the community, and we are encouraged to see local, healthy food being a priority for people here. Thank you!
