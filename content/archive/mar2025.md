Happy spring! We're safely on the other side of the lambing season. This was our first time lambing, and we learned a lot. It was fun and joyful, and also exhausting and dispiriting when it didn't go well. While we did lose two lambs at birth, all the ewes made it through, and there are eleven lambs leaping and racing around. It's been fun to watch them find their legs and make friends with each other. They're also growing extraordinarily quickly!

We also have ten baby chicks and four ducklings in the brooder right now to expand our egg-laying flock. All-in-all, it's a very cute time at the farm.

We have one beehive that made it through the winter, and new packages coming in April. There have been a few warm days already this year where we've seen the bees out and about and bringing pollen in, which is very satisfying to see! 

We are going to be teaching an intro to beekeeping class at Olympic College in June. You can sign up [here](https://www.campusce.net/olympic/course/course.aspx?C=128&pc=25&mc=0&sc=0) if you're interested! This year will be classroom-only, but eventually we'd like to figure out how to do on-farm classes too, and open beehives with folks.

We are also deep into planning our vegetable crops for the season. We'll be growing sweet potatoes and corn again, but are planning on expanding a bit this year, though largely sticking with our theme of long-season storage crops. We'll be adding some winter squash, potatoes, beans, peppers, onions, leeks, and more to the mix! We're started seeds for things like tomatoes for our personal garden. It's always a delight to get our fingers back in the soil in the spring and see little seedlings popping up.

Finally - we just want to acknowledge that there are a lot of things in the world that feel complicated right now -- things are less safe for some people in our communities, and none of it is reflective of the care and community we wish for everyone. It's hard to know the right thing to do, but for us, growing food and sharing it with all of you feels like one of the right things. Thank you for being part of our community.
