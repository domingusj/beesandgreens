Well, it's been three months since we've written (sorry!), and we've been busy. Just about everything is harvested now - you can barely see our home through all the corn hanging from our porch railings and the pie pumpkins and candy roaster squash lining it. The greenhouse is bursting with sweet potatoes and more corn. We're ready to settle into the shorter, rainy days where all that's left to do is eat all this good stuff. 

### Sweet Potatoes

We harvested nearly 1,000 pounds of sweet potatoes at the end of September. They've been curing for a month now, and they're ready to eat!

Thanks to everyone who has stopped by the farm stand the past couple weeks and bought some. Moving forward, you can find them on [Kitsap Fresh](https://kitsapfresh.localfoodmarketplace.com/Products?search=Sweet%20potato) - a new ordering period opens tomorrow (Saturday) morning, and we have lots on there, both white and orange flesh, from fingerling size, to your more "average" sweet potato size, and a few truly massive 3-5 pound specimens. You can get lots of other yummy local veggies there too! It's a great way to support a bunch of your local farmers all in one spot, even if you can't make it out to your farmers market.

Here are some of our favorite ways to eat them:
* Sweet potato fries - we're really delighted to live in the time of air friers
* Soups and stews of all kinds. One favorite is [this sweet potato, peanut butter, lentil stew](https://frommybowl.com/sweet-potato-peanut-stew/)
* Fried rice and stir fry
* Sweet potato, black bean, and quinoa burgers. We make big batches of these, and freeze the leftovers
* If you're really feeling ambitious, sweet potato gnocchi is a fun rainy-day project, and those rainy days are coming!

### Microgreens

After a couple months off this summer while we got our new setup dialed in and during the peak heat, microgreens are back in action and available fresh every Friday at Bay Hay & Feed! 

### Corn

Shucking glass gem corn was like Christmas morning, each time - each one was different, and you never knew what you were going to get! We'll grind most of this.

We also grew Amish butter popcorn. It's been fairly humid, so it still needs some time to dry, but we're hoping it will be popping delicious! Once it starts popping, we'll be sure to let you know where you can get some.

### Farm stand

After today, the farm stand is officially closed for the season. We're so grateful to everyone who stopped by over the past few months. We've loved waving at you as you stopped by, seeing some familiar faces along with some new ones, and being able to share our bounty with you. One of our projects for this winter is going to be to see if we can rig up a covering that will allow us to stay open even on rainy days. 

The sheep appreciated when we put corn stalks out at the farm stand too!
