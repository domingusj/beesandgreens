We are Justin and Adrienne and we're beekeepers and farmers. Our goal is to provide high-quality, nutritious food for our community. We try our best to use minimal packaging, sell locally, and ensure that our practices are helping to build healthy soil. We grow microgreens that we harvest weekly year-round, and storage crops like sweet potatoes and corn.
