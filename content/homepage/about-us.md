We are Justin and Adrienne - we're beekeepers and farmers. Justin grew up farming, and we have been farming together since we moved to Kitsap County in 2021. We bought our own farm in Kingston in 2025 and are looking forward to feeding the community and stewarding this land for many years to come. 

We try our best to use minimal packaging, sell locally, and ensure that our practices are helping to build healthy soil. We grow microgreens that we harvest weekly year-round, and otherwise focus on growing storage crops like sweet potatoes, corn, onions, winter squash and more. We also keep chickens and ducks for their eggs and the laughs.
