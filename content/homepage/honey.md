We sell fresh, local honey from our beehives on Bainbridge Island, WA.

[Contact Us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") for prices and availability.

Our honey is raw, unfiltered, and natural. We want our bees to be as healthy and happy as possible, and they reward us in return with excellent quality honey.

Honey is delicious all by itself! It can also be enjoyed with bread, stirred into tea, mixed into sauces and salad dressings, used in baking recipes, or drizzled on top of ice cream! (Note: Honey should not be fed to infants under 1 year of age.)

Our bees forage on a wide variety of Pacific Northwest plants including maples, blackberries, fireweed, and wildflowers in the area.
