Microgreens are small, delicious, baby vegetable greens that can be added to almost any meal. They are great in salads, smoothies, soups, stir fries, scrambled eggs, or tacos! You can add a handful of fresh microgreens to just about anything to add flavor, texture, and nutrition. We grow a variety of microgreens including broccoli, lettuce mixes, radishes, sunflowers, and peas.
