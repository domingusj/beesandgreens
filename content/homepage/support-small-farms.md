We know that buying your food from small farms isn't always the simplest thing. You have to go somewhere other than where you get most of your groceries, and sometimes it costs more. 

However, these farms often grow a wider variety of crops using more sustainable practices, which means the food is fresher, more nutritionally dense, and grown closer to where you live. By choosing local, seasonal produce from small farms, you're not just getting better food, you're also helping to create a more resilient and healthy local food system.

Thank you for supporting your small farmers, wherever you live.
