#### Honey

Justin grew up keeping bees and was a beekeeping extensionist in the Peace Corps in Paraguay (where we met!). We now keep hives on our farm in Kingston, WA.

Our bees forage on a wide variety of Pacific Northwest plants including maples, blackberries, fireweed, and wildflowers in the area, and our honey reflects this - it may be a slightly different color and flavor profile from year to year based on what was available for the bees to forage.

[Contact Us]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Us") for prices and availability. We typically harvest in late summer.

#### Microgreens

Microgreens are small, delicious, baby vegetable greens that can be added to almost any meal. They are great in salads, smoothies, soups, stir fries, scrambled eggs, or tacos! You can add a handful of fresh microgreens to just about anything to add flavor, texture, and nutrition. We grow a variety of microgreens including broccoli, lettuce mixes, radishes, and peas.

Our microgreens are available for sale in the market at [Bay Hay and Feed](https://bayhayandfeed.com/) in Rolling Bay on Bainbridge Island.

#### Storage Crops

We first started growing sweet potatoes with [Betsey from Laughing Crow Farm](https://www.instagram.com/farmerbetsey4?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MTJqNXBhcDQ3YXk1Ng==) on Bainbridge Island, and this grew into a love of all things storage crops.

We grow corn (grinding corn and popcorn), sweet potatoes, potatoes, garlic, winter squash, onions, and more. We eat them all through the winter (soups and stews! veggie burgers! roasts! just imagine the possibilities) and share it with you via [Kitsap Fresh](https://kitsapfresh.org/).
